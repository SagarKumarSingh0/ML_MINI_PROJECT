# ML_MINI_PROJECT
This is a Machine Learning mini project developed as part of my learning journey. The project involves building a predictive model using supervised learning techniques. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results. The goal of the project is to gain hands-on experience with the ML workflow.
